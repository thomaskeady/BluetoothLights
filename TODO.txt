Todos for the lights:

Reset arduino from Simblee because sometimes it becomes unresponsive
	Use RST pin
	Is problem from serial not clearing entirely?

How reprogram arduino without breaking connections between it and simblee? 
	I think this is fine, arduino RX should never output anything
	BUT WHEN IT IS DRIVEN FROM THE USB IT WILL BE 5V - therefore no good
